## DATA ENTRY IN EXCEL( Data Entry fundamentals, Formatting in Excel and Data Validation)
Data entry formats are to be considered for instance we have flat files and csv formats. Flat files have data in table formats whereas CVS are comma-separated values,
Certain text validation tools are usually used in Excel functions;
LEFT, RIGHT AND MID.
=LEFT which is made up of (text,number_xharacter). The left function has two arguments,
=RIGHT( text, number_character). The Right function also has two arguments,
=MID( text, start-number, number_character). The MID function has three arguments
Note: text means the particular text details, start_number is the character you want to start from while Number_character is the number of characters you are looking for.
###**VLOOKUP FUNCTION AND CELL REFERENCING**
###**#VLOOKUP** 
This is an Excel function for bringing an exact match. It has four arguments, three of the arguments are mandatory and one is optional.
=VLOOKUP( lookup_value, Table_array,Column_index_num, Range_lookup) note the Range_lookup is the optinal argument.
Note: lookup_value is the column common on both tables and should always be your first value in your VLookup function.
      Table_array is the table that has what you want to return something from i.e whatever you are looking for,
      Column_index_Num asks what position the column you want to fetch from your table array,
      Range_lookup ( Exact, approximate) False gives you the exact match.
####**CELL REFERENCING**
This is how you want Excel to treat what you are referencing. It implies how your result moves from the actual cell you are fitting into. There are two types of cell referencing ( Absolute and Relative).
Absolute Referencing: This is a way of locking your cell so it doesn't change.
This comprises of Column Constant, Row constant
Relative Referencing: This is a way of not locking your cell allowing it to move freely.
